After a few fist fights with Tumblr, followed by neglect and subsequent loss of my domain name, I decided it was time I jumped ship and found a better blogging tool. Here goes GitHub Pages and Jekyll!  If you see more posts on my GitHub site than at my previous <a href="http://datasciencegirl.tumblr.com/">Tumblr site!</a>, then you will know I am a convert.


#Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

#{% highlight ruby %}
#def print_hi(name)
#  puts "Hi, #{name}"
#end
#print_hi('Tom')
##=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
#{% endhighlight %}

#Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
