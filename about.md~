As a scientist and modeler, what I love most about my research is the use of programming to analyze and visualize data in order to deepen my understanding of the processes that drive observed trends. My passion for data analysis and visualization has guided me toward an interest in leveraging my research, analytical, programming, and communication skills in order to contribute to a team of data scientists striving to find actionable solutions to challenging questions. I love being a data scientist because that means that I get to learn every day as I continue to add tools to my data analysis toolbox.
